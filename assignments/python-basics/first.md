## Assignment 1

1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
- `*`
- `'hello'`
- `-87.8`
- `-`
- `/`
- `+`
- `6`

ans: 

- `*` : expression
- `'hello'` : value
- `-87.8` : value
- `-` : expression
- `+` : expression
- `/` : expression
- `+` : expression
- `6` : value


2. What is the difference between string and variable?
ans: 
- string: a string is a data-type. Anything between double quotes(" ") or single quotes(' ') is a string
   ex: "body" or '123'
 
 - variable: a variable is used to assign or store the    values at a specific memory location. It is like a BOX or CONTAINER.
  ex: num = 65     or      marks = 88.8



3. Describe three different data types.
ans:
- Integer: it is a whole number, positive or negative ,but without the decimal point. It have unlimited length.

- float: floating point number are with decimal values or fractional values like 67.9

- boolean: It returns the true or false based on the condition.




4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
ans:
- expression is made up of combination of variables, operators, or function calls that return a single value.
- with the help of expression, we can compute values, assign values, return values, we can also used it for passing an argument or in control flow statement.
