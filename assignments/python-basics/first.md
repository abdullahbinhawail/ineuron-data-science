## Assignment 1

1.**In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.**
- `*`
- `'hello'`
- `-87.8`
- `-`
- `/`
- `+`
- `6`


ans: 

- `*` : expression
- `'hello'` : value
- `-87.8` : value
- `-` : expression
- `+` : expression
- `/` : expression
- `+` : expression
- `6` : value




2. **What is the difference between string and variable?**

ans: 
- string: a string is a data-type. Anything between double quotes(" ") or single quotes(' ') is a string
   ex: "body" or '123'
 
 - variable: a variable is used to assign or store the    values at a specific memory location. It is like a BOX or CONTAINER.
  ex: num = 65     or      marks = 88.8





3. **Describe three different data types.**

ans:
- Integer: it is a whole number, positive or negative ,but without the decimal point. It have unlimited length.

- float: floating point number are with decimal values or fractional values like 67.9

- boolean: It returns the true or false based on the condition.





4. **What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?**

ans:
- expression is made up of combination of variables, operators, or function calls that return a single value.
- with the help of expression, we can compute values, assign values, return values, we can also used it for passing an argument or in control flow statement.




5. **This assignment statements, like `spam = 10`. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?**

ans:
- An expression evaluates to a single value.
- A statement does not evaluate to a single value.




6. **After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?**

- `bacon = 22`
- `baccon + 1`

ans:
- 22
- Explanation: `bacon + 1` is an expression which evaluates to `23` but we are not assigning it to any variable. So, the value of bacon remains `22`.




7. **What should the values of the following two terms be?**

`'spam' + 'spamspam'`
`'spam' * 3`

ans:
- `'spam' + 'spamspam'` 
- `'spam' * 3` : `'spamspamspam'`




8. **Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?**

ans:
- Variable names cannot start with a number and hence `100` is invalid.




9. **What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?**

ans:
- int() for getting integer version of a value
- float() for getting floating-point number version of a value
- str() for getting string version of a value



10. **Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?**

'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'

ans:
